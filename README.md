# Finding-Lanes
The project provides a basic algorithm which detects lane markings from an image or a video stream.

## File Structure
1. `test_images` and `test_videos` are the folders which contain the images and videos on which lane detection should be performed.
2. `P1.ipynb` contains the code.
3. Just run the code and all the images present in the `test_images` and `test_videos` folders will be processed.
4. The images and videos marked with the lines on the lanes will be saved into `test_images_output` and `test_videos_output` folders respectively.
